Molten Obsidian is a high-performance library designed as an easily integrated and lightweight FOSS alternative to [Obsidian Publish](https://publish.obsidian.md). 
With extensibility and integration-oriented conception, this library makes it perfect for integrating Obsidian-flavoured markdown notes on your Blazor App, but also importing entire vaults as a navigation-ready area, with full routing support.

Furthermore, Molten Obsidian extends past the original [Obsidian specifications](https://help.obsidian.md/), aiming to supercharge your documentation/wiki applications and websites needs, using a customizable data source interface, and supercharged YAML frontmatter capabilities.
